# rebuilding-carousel-bootstrap-practice
This is a practice project of rebuilding the Carousel example so that I can start using Bootstrap. 

I found it really helpful to rebuild https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/examples/carousel/ as it allowed me to analize how a simple bootstrap page was created. 

Doing so forced me to look up different Bootstrap specific classes, layout principles and play around with media queries.
